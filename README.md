# "AM" Application Manager
### Database & solutions for all AppImages and portable apps for GNU/Linux!

![Istantanea_2024-06-17_16-23-49 png](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/assets/88724353/ff4709c8-a3b2-4a1e-84ab-72700934809f)

"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.

The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).

"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.

You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).

# Differences between "AM" and "AppMan"
"AM" and "AppMan" differ in how they are installed, placed and renamed in the system and how/where they install apps:
- "**AM**" is installed system-wide (requires `sudo`) in `/opt/am/` as "**APP-MANAGER**", with a symlink named "`am`" in `/usr/local/bin`.
- "**AppMan**" is portable, you need just to rename the "APP-MANAGER" script as "`appman`" and put it wherewer you want. I recommend to place it in `$HOME/.local/bin` to be used in $PATH, to be managed from other tools (see below).

Both can be updated using "[Topgrade](https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade)".

### Ownership
- "**AM**" is owned by the user that have installed it, since other users have not read/write permissions in "/opt/am";
- "**AppMan**" is for all users, since it works locally, everyone can have its own apps and configurations.

### About "sudo" usage
- "AppMan" can request the root password only in the very rare case in which you want to install a library;
- "AM" requires the root password only to install, remove apps, enable a sandbox for an AppImage, or enable/disable bash completion.

All options cannot be executed with "`sudo`".

### How apps are installed
- "**AM**" installs apps system wide, in `/opt` (see [Linux Standard Base](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch03s13.html)), using the following structure:
```
/opt/$PROGRAM/
/opt/$PROGRAM/$PROGRAM
/opt/$PROGRAM/AM-updater
/opt/$PROGRAM/remove
/opt/$PROGRAM/icons/$ICON-NAME
/usr/local/bin/$PROGRAM
/usr/share/applications/AM-$PROGRAM.desktop
```
If the distro is immutable or have read-only mount points instead, the path of the launcher (the last line above) will change like this:
```
/usr/local/share/applications/AM-$PROGRAM.desktop
```

- "**AppMan**" is more flexible, since it asks you where to install the apps in your $HOME directory. For example, suppose you want install everything in "Applicazioni" (the italian of "applications"), this is the structure of what an installation scripts installs with "AppMan" instead:
```
~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/
~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/$PROGRAM
~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/AM-updater
~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/remove
~/Applicazioni/$PROGRAM/icons/$ICON-NAME
~/.local/bin/$PROGRAM
~/.local/share/applications/AM-$PROGRAM.desktop
```
The configuration file for AppMan is in `~/.config/appman` and contains the path you indicated at first startup. Changing its contents will result in changing the paths for each subsequent operation carried out with "AppMan", the apps and modules stored in the old path will not be manageable.

At first startup you can indicate any directory or subdirectory you want, as long as it is in your $HOME.

### How to use "AM" in non-privileged mode, like "AppMan"
As already mentioned above, at "[Ownership](#ownership)" the user who installed "AM" is the sole owner, having write permissions for both /opt/am and for all installed apps.

However, every user of the same system is allowed to use the option `--user` or `appman`, to use "AM" as "AppMan" and to install apps locally and withour root privileges:
```
am --user
```
To switch "AM" back to "AM" from "AppMan Mode", use the always suggested option `--system`:
```
am --system
```
To perform a test and see if you are in "AppMan Mode" or not, run for example the command `am -f` to see the list of the installed apps.

In this video I'll install LXtask locally:

https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/assets/88724353/65b27cf6-edc5-4a4c-b2f9-42e8623dc76f

NOTE: non-privileged users can update their own local applications and modules, but cannot update /opt/am/APP-MANAGER.

It is therefore suggested to use pure "AppMan" instead of the "AppMan Mode" of "AM".

# What programs can be installed
"AM"/"AppMan" installs, removes, updates and manages only standalone programs, ie those programs that can be run from a single directory in which they are contained. The database aims to be a reference point where you can download all the AppImage packages scattered around the web, otherwise unobtainable, as you would expect from any package manager, through specific installation scripts for each application, as happens with the AUR PKGBUILDs, on Arch Linux. You can see all of them [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/programs)", divided by architecture.

NOTE that currently my work focuses on applications for x86_64 architecture, but it is possible to extend "AM" to all other available architectures. If you are interested, you can deliberately join this project to improve the lists above.

1. **PROGRAMS**, they are taken:
- from official sources (see Firefox, Thunderbird, Blender, NodeJS, Chromium Latest, Platform Tools...);
- extracted from official .deb/tar/zip packages;
- from the repositories and official sites of individual developers.

2. **APPIMAGES**, they are taken:
- from official sources (if the upstream developers provide them);
- from AppImage recipes to be compiled on-the-fly with [pkg2appimage](https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage) and [appimagetool](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit);
- from unofficial third-party developers, but only if an official release is not available.

3. **FIREFOX PROFILES** to run as webapps, the ones with suffix "ffwa-" in the apps list.

4. **THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES** (see [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/libraries/libs-list)) if they are not provided in your distribution's repositories. These are to be installed in truly exceptional cases.

You can consult basic information, links to sites and sources used through the related `am -a $PROGRAM` command.

# How to update all programs, for real
One of the reasons why many users hate Appimages is because they cannot be updated. Or at least not all.

One of the reasons why many users hate Appimages is because they cannot be updated. Or at least not all.

This project was born to dispel this myth and to solve the problem. And the solution is much more trivial than you expect.

There are several methods to update apps, here are the most common ones, in order of priority:
- the "comparison between versions" is the most widespread in the database, the version of the app installed is compared with the one present at the source, be it an official site or another site that tracks it;
- if an AppImage package has a .zsync file, that will be used to download binary deltas (especially useful with large files, but not very popular among developers);
- some portable apps are self-updatable (see Firefox and Thunderbird);
- if an app or script is extremely small (a few kilobytes), it is downloaded directly from scratch;
- in rare cases, if a file .zsync is broken, we use [appimageupdatetool](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageUpdate);
- in some cases, the apps have a fixed version, both due to the developers' choices to abandon a portable package in favor of other more common platforms, and because a software is no longer developed.

NOTE, fixed versions will be listed with their build number (e.g. $PROGRAM-1.1.1) or will be added only upon request.

### How to update all installed apps
Option `-u` or `update` updates all the installed apps and keeps "AM"/"AppMan" in sync with the latest version and all latest bug fixes.

https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/assets/88724353/f93ca782-2fc6-45a0-a3f2-1fba297a92bf

1. To update only the programs, use `am -u --apps` / `appman -u --apps`
2. To update just one program, use `am -u $PROGRAM` / `appman -u $PROGRAM`
3. To update all the programs and "AM"/"AppMan" itself, just run the command`am -u` / `appman -u`
4. To update only "AM"/"AppMan" and the modules use the option `-s` instead, `am -s` / `appman -s`

NOTE, non-privileged users using "AM" in "AppMan Mode" cannot update /opt/am/APP-MANAGER (points 3 and 4). See "[How to use AM in non-privileged mode, like AppMan](#how-to-use-am-in-non-privileged-mode-like-appman)".

# Installation
This section explains how to install "AM" or "AppMan".

If you don't know the difference, please read "[Differences between "AM" and "AppMan"](#differences-between-am-and-appman)" first.

Below are the essential dependencies for both "AM" and "AppMan":
- "`coreutils`", is usually installed by default in all distributions as it contains basic commands ("`cat`", "`chmod`", "`chown`"...);
- "`curl`", to check URLs;
- "`grep`", to check files;
- "`jq`", to handle JSON files (some scripts need to check a download URL from api.github.com);
- "`sed`", to edit/adapt installed files;
- "`wget`" to download all programs and update "AM"/"AppMan" itself;

NOTE, "AM" require "`sudo`" to be installed.

If for some reason you don't use `sudo` and you prefer to gain administration privileges using alternative commands such as `doas` or similar, simply use "AppMan".

<details>
  <summary>See also optional dependencies, click here!</summary>

#### Listed below are optional dependencies that are needed only by some programs:
- "`binutils`", contains a series of basic commands, including "`ar`" which extracts .deb packages;
- "`unzip`", to extract .zip packages;
- "`tar`", to extract .tar* packages;
- "`zsync`", about 10% of AppImages depend on this to be updated.

## How to install "AM"
"**AM**" is ment to be installed at system level to manage apps.

The script "[INSTALL](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/INSTALL)" is the one that take care of this.

#### Using "Wget"
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-hc/AM/main/INSTALL
chmod a+x ./INSTALL
sudo ./INSTALL
```
or directly
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-hc/AM/main/INSTALL && chmod a+x ./INSTALL && sudo ./INSTALL
```

#### Using "GIT"
```
git clone https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM.git
cd AM
chmod a+x INSTALL
sudo ./INSTALL
```

### Structure of the "AM" installation
In both cases, the "INSTALL" script will create:
- the script "/opt/am/APP-MANAGER"
- the script "/opt/am/remove" (to remove "AM" using the command `am -R am`)
- the directory "/opt/am/.cache" (where all processes will been executed)
- the directory "/opt/am/modules" (containing the .am modules for the non-core options)
- the symlink "/usr/local/bin/am" for "/opt/am/APP-MANAGER"

NOTE, if you don't feel comfortable having to always use root permissions, the installation method for "AppMan" is totally different. If you are interested, go [to the next paragraph](#how-to-install-appman), else [Back to "Main Index"](#main-index) or jump to "[Usage (all the available options)](#usage)".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## How to install "AppMan"
"**AppMan**" can be used in different places, being it portable.

However, to be easily used its recommended to place it in your local "$PATH", in `~/.local/bin`.

#### Use "AppMan" in "$PATH"
To do so, you must first enable that "$PATH":
- add `export PATH=$PATH:$(xdg-user-dir USER)/.local/bin` in the ` ~/.bashrc`
- create the directory `~/.local/bin` if it is not available

To do all this quickly, simply copy/paste the following command:
```
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(xdg-user-dir USER)/.local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-hc/AM/main/APP-MANAGER -O appman && chmod a+x ./appman && mv ./appman ~/.local/bin/appman
```
#### Use "AppMan" in "Portable Mode"
"AppMan" can run in any directory you download it, copy/paste the following command to download "APP-MANAGER", rename it to `appman` and make it executable:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-hc/AM/main/APP-MANAGER -O appman && chmod a+x ./appman
```

### Structure of the "AppMan" installation
Unlike "AM" which needs to be placed in specific locations, "AppMan" is portable. The modules and directories will be placed in the directory you chose:
- the script "appman" is wherever you want
- the directory "$HOME/path/to/your/custom/directory/.cache" (where all processes will been executed)
- the directory "$HOME/path/to/your/custom/directory/modules" (containing the .am modules for the non-core options)
- the configuration file "$HOME/.config/appman/appman-config" (the only fixed directory)

| - |

------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Uninstall
- To uninstall "AM" just run the command `am -R am`
- To uninstall "AppMan" just remove it and the directory `$HOME/.config/appman`

Note, before you remove your CLI, use the option `-R` to remove the apps installed using the following syntax:
```
am -R {PROGRAM1} {PROGRAM2} {PROGRAM3}...
```
or
```
appman -R {PROGRAM1} {PROGRAM2} {PROGRAM3}...
```

to have a list of the installed programs use the option `-f` or `files` (syntax `am -f` or `appman -f`).

### How to remove one or more applications
Option `-R` removes the selected apps without asking (to have a prompt, use `-r` or `remove`):

### How to convert Type2 AppImages requiring libfuse2 to Type3 AppImages
Option `nolibfuse` "just tries" to convert old Type2 AppImages asking for "libfuse2" into new Type3 AppImages:

https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/assets/88724353/06b8e946-ef02-4678-a5a0-d8c2c24c22f9

First the selected program type is checked, if it is a Type2 AppImage, it will be extracted and repackaged using the new version of `appimagetool` from https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage :
- if the update occurs through "comparison" of versions, the converted AppImage will be replaced by the upstream version and the command is added within the application's AM-updater script, so as to automatically start the conversion at each update (prolonging the update time, depending on the size of the AppImage);
- instead, if the installed AppImage can be updated via `zsync`, **this may no longer be updatable**.

**I suggest anyone to contact the developers to update the packaging method of their AppImage!**

NOTE, the conversion is not always successful, a lot depends on how the program is packaged. The conversion occurs in two steps:
1. if in the first case it succeeds without problems, the package will be repackaged as it was, but of Type 3;
2. if the script encounters problems (due to Appstream validation), it will attempt to delete the contents of the /usr/share/metainfo directory inside the AppImage, as a workaround.

If also the second step does not succeed either, the process will end with an error and the AppImage will remain Type2.

### How to create launchers and shortcuts for my local AppImages
Option `--launcher` allows you to drag/drop a local AppImage and creates the launcher (like any other classic AppImage manager, but in SHELL, so no daemons or bloated runtimes are required here) in $HOME/.local/share/applications/AppImages, also allows you to rename a symlink in $HOME/.local/bin that you can use from the command line like any other program:

### How to sandbox an AppImage
Since version 5.3 you can use the `--sandbox` option to run AppImages using a sandbox, and since version 6.12 Firejails has been dropped in favour of "[Aisap](https://github.com/mgord9518/aisap)", a [Bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) frontend for AppImages.

This method works as follows:
```
am --sandbox $APP
```
or
```
appman --sandbox $APP
```
- if the "aisap" package is not installed, you will be asked if you want to install it via "AM"/AppMan;
- requires replacing the symlink in $PATH with a script ("AM" users will need the root password);
- to work, the Appimage will be set to "not executable", and the AM-updater will also have its `chmod` command set to `a-x` instead of `a+x`.

The default location for the sandboxed homes is at $HOME/.local/am-sandboxes, but that location can be changed by setting the $SANDBOXDIR env variable.

To restore the use of the AppImage without sandbox, you need to run the application command with the "--disable-sandbox" option:
```
$APP --disable-sandbox
```

### How to enable bash completion
Bash completion is enabled in "AM" on first installation, while the "AppMan" one requires to be enabled manually.

For both there are two options:
- `--enabe-completion` to enable it;
- `--disable-completion` to disable it.

The file used by "AM" is "/etc/bash_completion.d/am-completion.sh", so the root password is required to use the options. The file used by "AppMan" instead is "$HOME/.bash_completion".

Both use the keywords to be completed listed within the "list" file, generated from the options list and the applications list.

### How to update or remove apps manually
Inside each installed applications directory, there are two scripts called "AM-updater" and "remove", and their purpose is indicated in their name:
- To update an app manually, run the AM-updater script.
- To remove an application instead, run the "remove" script (with "`sudo`" if you are an "AM" user).

__________________________________________________________________________
### How to downgrade an installed app to a previous version
Use the `--rollback` option or `downgrade` in this way:
```
am --rollback ${PROGRAM}
```
This only works with the apps hosted on Github.

### Create and test your own installation script
"AM"/"AppMan" has an option `-t` or `template` with which you can get a script to customize according to your needs.

The available options are as follows:

0. Create a script for an AppImage package
1. Build an AppImage on the fly using [appimagetool](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit) and [pkg2appimage](https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage)
2. Download and unpack a generic archive (ZIP, TAR...)
3. Create a custom Firefox profile

The currently available templates are stored [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/templates).

![Istantanea_2024-06-17_21-35-26 png](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/assets/88724353/6e11aeff-9a70-44f7-bd73-1324b545704e)

In the following video you see how option 1 (formerly option 5) is able to create AppImage packages on the fly (here "Abiword" from Debian Unstable), like an AUR compiler would:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88724353/150619523-a45455f6-a656-4753-93fe-aa99babc1083.mp4

A wiki is also available, here I will try to explain the installation script's workflow for a program to be better managed by "AM", trying to use a language that is as simple and elementary as possible.

Each script is written exclusively for "AM" and is structured in such a way that even "[AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan)" can modify it to manage programs locally.

We can divide the stages of an installation's process as follows:

* [Step 1: create the main directory](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-1:-create-the-main-directory) in /opt, as already suggested by the [Linux Standard Base](https://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/opt.html) (LSB);
* [Step 2: create the "remove" script](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-2:-create-the-%22remove%22-script), needed to uninstall averything (this must be the first one to be created, in order to quickly resolve any aborted/brocken installations using the `-r` option);
* [Step 3: download the program](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-3:-download-the-program) and/or compile the program (this operation varies depending on how the program is distributed);
* [Step 4: link to a $PATH](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-4:-link-to-a-$PATH) (usually `/usr/local/bin`, but also `/usr/bin`, `/usr/games` or `/usr/local/games`);
* [Step 5: the "AM updater" script](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-5:-the-%22AM-updater%22-script), which is a kind of "copy" of step "3" (see above) that may include options to recognize newer versions of the program. NOTE that if you intend to create a script for the fixed version of a program, you can also skip this step;
* [Step 6: launchers and icons](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-6:-launchers-and-icons). Note that if you intend to create a script for a command line utility, you can also skip this step;
* [Step 7: change the permissions](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-7:-permissions) in the program folder, so you can use the update function (step 5) without using "sudo" privileges
* [Step 8 (optional): your signature](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/wiki/Step-8-(optional):-your-signature)

The most difficult step to overcome is certainly the number "3", given the great variety of methods in which authors distribute their software, while all the other steps are much easier to overcome.

To install and test your own script, use the command `am -i /path/to/your-script` or `appman -i /path/to/your-script` depending on your CLI

### Third-party databases for applications (NeoDB)
"AM"/"AppMan" can be extended by adding new application databases using a configuration file named "neodb".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### An application does not work, is old and unsupported
Use the `-a` option and go to the developer's site to report the problem. The task of "AM" is solely to install / remove / update the applications managed by it. Problems related to the failure of an installed program or any related bugs are attributable solely to its developers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Cannot download or update an application
There can be many reasons:
- check your internet connection;
- if the app is hosted on github.com, you have probably exceeded the hourly limit of API calls;
- the referring link may have been changed, try the `--rollback` option or `downgrade`;
- the reference site has changed, report any changes at https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Cannot mount and run AppImages
If by running it in the terminal you get an error message about "FUSE" or "libfuse"/"libfuse2" missing, take a look at the official documentation:

https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/troubleshooting/fuse.html

If your distro does not provide `libfuse2`, you can install it using the command:
```
am -i libfuse2
```
or
```
appman -i libfuse2
```
NOTE, in AppMan you still need to use your password (`sudo`) to install the library at system level, in /usr/local/lib

Alternatively you can use the "`nolibfuse`" option to "try" to convert old Type2 AppImages to Type3, so as not to depend on `libfuse2`. In most cases it works, but sometimes it can give errors, depending on how the package was manufactured.

However, I suggest contacting the upstream developers to convince them to upgrade their packages to Type3.

* **If you cannot run some AppImages on Ubuntu 23.10+ or its derivatives, then refer to [Restricted unprivileged user namespaces are coming to Ubuntu 23.10 | Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-23-10-restricted-unprivileged-user-namespaces) for possible causes and remedies.**
* **If you cannot run chrome/chromium/electron-based AppImages, then refer to [Troubleshooting/Electron-sandboxing](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/troubleshooting/electron-sandboxing.html) for possible causes and remedies.**

### Spyware, malware and dangerous software
Before installing any application, try to know where it comes from first. This program provides you with two basic options for this purpose:
- Option `-a` or `about` (medium safety), allows you to read a short description and know the links from the pages of the site [https://portable-linux-apps.github.io](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io) locally, however these links may be inaccurate due to continuous updates of the initial scripts (you can provide additional info yourself by modifying the pages of the site, [here](https://github.com/Portable-Linux-Apps/Portable-Linux-Apps.github.io), it is also open source);
- Option `-d` or `download` (absolute safety), this allows you to get the installation script directly on your desktop, so you can read the mechanisms and how it performs the downloads from the sources (in most cases there is a header for each step that explains what the listed commands do).

“AM” and AppMan are just tools to easily install all listed programs, but what you choose to install is your complete responsibility. **Use at your own risk**!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Stop AppImage prompt to create its own launcher, desktop integration and doubled launchers
Some developers insist on creating Appimages that create their own launcher on first launch (like WALC and OpenShot). If the official solution proposed [here](https://discourse.appimage.org/t/stop-appimage-from-asking-to-integrate/488) doesn't work, create a .home directory with the `-H` option, launch the app and accept the request. For example (with "AM"):
```
am -H walc
walc
```
Accept the integration request, the launcher will be saved in the walc.home directory located next to the AppImage file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### The script points to "releases" instead of downloading the latest stable
This is a choice I made as many developers have abandoned support for AppImage or GNU/Linux in general. My aim here is to introduce you to other developers' applications, then it's up to you to contact them, support them, help improve the software through forks and pull requests, opening issues and encouraging developers to keep the software in the format you prefer.

In case you are sure that the upstream developer will maintain the package for each stable release, you can fix this in several ways:
#### Method 1: Direct installation by combining `-d` and `-i` options
```
am -d $PROGRAM
sed -i 's#releases -O -#releases/latest -O -#g' $(xdg-user-dir DESKTOP)/$PROGRAM
am -i $(xdg-user-dir DESKTOP)/$PROGRAM
```
#### Method 2: "Downgrade" the installed app to "latest"
Use the option `--force-latest` to patch the AM-updater and perform the "update"/"downgrade":
```
am --force-latest $PROGRAM
```
or do it manually:
```
sed -i 's#releases -O -#releases/latest -O -#g' /opt/$PROGRAM/AM-updater
am -u $PROGRAM
```

### Wget2 prevents me from downloading apps and modules
With the arrival of Fedora 40 in April 2024, many users began to complain about the inability to download any application from github and the inability to update modules (see https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/issues/496). This is because "wget" is no longer actively developed, and its successor "wget2" was not yet ready to take its place immediately. Yet the Fedora team decided to replace it anyway, causing quite a few problems for this project and many others that use api.github.com to function.

Attempts to add patches to avoid having dependencies like `jq` added and to rewrite all the scripts to promptly adapt them to more versatile solutions were in vain.

So I decided to host on this repository the "wget" binaries directly from Debian 12 (see [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/tools/x86_64) and [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/tree/main/tools/aarch64)), and the installation scripts dedicated to them, for the [x86_64](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/programs/x86_64/wget) and [aarch64](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/programs/x86_64/wget) architectures and which use "wget2" to download the executable.

Run the command
```
am -i wget
```
NOTE, the binary is called from a script in /usr/local/bin that runs "wget" with the "--no-check-certificate" option. It's not the best of solutions, but it's enough to suppress this shortcoming while the compatibility issue between wget and wget2 will not be completely resolved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Wrong download link
The reasons may be two:
- the referring link may have been changed, try the `--rollback` option or `downgrade`;
- the reference site has changed, report any changes at https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/issues
