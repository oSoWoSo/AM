 Libreoffice versions are classified according to functionality (STILL and
 FRESH) and the number of languages included (STANDARD and FULL):
  - STILL is the Stable version (recommended), and it can be STANDARD or FULL;
  - FRESH has the most recent features, and it can be STANDARD or FULL;
  - STANDARD refers to the languages included, ie English (US and GB), Arabic,
    Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), French, German, Italian, Japanese,
    Korean, Portuguese (Brazilian and Portugal), Russian, and Spanish.

 2) STILL-FULL is the Stable version with support for ALL the languages;
 
 3) FRESH-STANDARD is the Testing version with support for SOME languages;
