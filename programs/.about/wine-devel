 WINE - Compatibility layer to run MS Windows apps and games on GNU/Linux.
 
 "Devel" is used to provide development headers, mostly used by third
 party software compilation.
 This version is for both x86 and x64 MS Windows programs.
 
 AM provides a generic "wine" command in /usr/bin for each version of wine 
 it manages (stable, devel or staging), so you can use it like this:
 
 	wine winecfg (this will launch WINE Config)
        wine <program>.exe (to launch a Windows program)
        
 NOTE that AM's "wine" command only refers to the version installed via AM,
 installing multiple versions simultaneously via this tool can cause 
 conflicts  between them. Download the AppImage separately if you want to 
 use multiple versions. 
 The "mmtrt" repository always provides the latest version for each of the 
 three development branches of WINE.
