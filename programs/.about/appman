 Application Manager for AppImages and other standalone programs,
 works like APT or Pacman.
 
 The new code base is forked from "AM" Application Manager 2.6.1-2
 and converts its installation scripts so that applications can be
 installed locally, so without having root privileges.
 
 Since the 2.0 release, AppMan took over the base code from its own
 successor, "AM" Application Manager and takes all sources from the
 "AM" repository itself.
 
 If before AppMan had its own archive of scripts and icons to install
 programs, the project was interrupted for several months, during
 the creation and development of "AM" application manager
 
 That code base also served to improve AppMan, which has a new life
 since March 2022.
 
 All AppMan does is to convert all the installation scripts for "AM"
 (that normally must be executed with ROOT privileges) in normal 
 scripts that can manage applications in the local folder of the 
 current user. This allows more users to be able to better configure
 their account.
