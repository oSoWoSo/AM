 killbots is a simple game of evading killer robots. 
 The robots are numerous and their sole objective is to 
 destroy you. Fortunately for you, their creator has 
 focused on quantity rather than quality and as a result 
 the robots are severely lacking in intelligence. 
 Your superior wit and a fancy teleportation device are 
 your only weapons against the never-ending stream of 
 mindless automatons.
