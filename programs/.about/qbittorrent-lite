 qBittorrent - A powerful QT-based Bittorrent Client.
 
 This is the UNOFFICIAL AppImage version, updatable and created
 by using its own AppImage tools (pkg2appimage and appimagetool).
 This version is lightweight and faster and has support for dark
 theming (if installed, Adwaita-dark is supported too).
 
 For the official version, see "qbittorrent".
