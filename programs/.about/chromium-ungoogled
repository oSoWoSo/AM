 Chromium Ungoogled - A modified version of Chromium Web Browser, the 
 Open source version of Google Chrome, Brave and others... but without
 any Google service.
 
 Also known as "Ungoogled Chromium", this is a modified version for 
 Slackware, with a black icon instead of a blue one.
 
 IMPORTANT (notice for users of 32-bit architectures):
 
 The most recent versions of Chromium are written and designed to take 
 full advantage of hardware acceleration, so many distributions that 
 still support 32-bit architecture optimize their (albeit outdated) 
 version of Chromium in order to work with the most modern web 
 technologies. 
 So, if you are a Debian (i686) or ArchLinux32 user, it is preferable 
 that you rely on the version found in the official repositories of your
 distribution, and only consider this version for testing purposes.
 
 The 64-bit architecture is the only one officially supported, while on
 32-bit systems it may be quite unstable.
 For the latter (if the 32-bit hardware is recent enough) you may be 
 prompted to run it with the "--no-sandbox" option.
 
 On the other hand, for particularly old computers and laptops (at least
 ten years old), the chances of successfully launching a working instance
 of Chromium are almost nil.
