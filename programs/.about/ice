 Ice SSB is a Webapp manager from the Peppermint OS project, that convert your 
 favourite Web pages to standalone apps.
 
 NOTE that to work it needs the browser binary to be at least linked in /usr/bin,
 if not, a message "NO SUITABLE BROWSER DETECTED" will appear.
 You can solve this issue by adding a script in /usr/bin that references to the
 main browser's binary, for example, if "firefox" is in /usr/local/bin, do:
 
    sudo echo -e '#!/bin/sh\n/usr/local/bin/firefox' >> /usr/bin/firefox
    sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/firefox

 On the project's website, you can read the following lines in the /usr/bin/ice 
 file, listing which browsers (and paths) are supported (lines 46 to 51):
 
     _BRAVE_BIN = "/usr/bin/brave-browser"
     _CHROME_BIN = "/usr/bin/google-chrome"
     _CHROMIUM_BIN = "/usr/bin/chromium-browser"
     _VIVALDI_BIN = "/usr/bin/vivaldi-stable"
     _FIREFOX_BIN = "/usr/bin/firefox"
     _EPIPHANY_BIN = "/usr/bin/epiphany"
     
 By installing browsers with "AM" (which most of the time install their binary in
 /usr/local/bin) you can resort to this small alternative solution, but adding
 the created file to the list of files to remove, this way:
 
   sudo echo -e '#!/bin/sh\n/usr/local/bin/$APP' >> /usr/bin/$BROWSER
   sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/$BROWSER
   echo 'rm -R -f /usr/bin/$BROWSER' >> /opt/$APP/remove
   
 Where $APP is the browser you have installed with "AM", and $BROWSER is one of the
 supported "keywords" of Ice ("brave-browser", "google-chrome", "chromium-browser",
 "vivaldi-browser", "firefox" and "epiphany").
 
 This AppImage will be always updated by the "am -u" command, being it weighs very
 few kilobytes. For furter updates and to join the project, visit their repository.
