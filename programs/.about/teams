 Microsoft Teams is a proprietary business communication platform
 developed by Microsoft, as part of the Microsoft 365 family of 
 products. Teams primarily competes with the similar service Slack,
 offering workspace chat and videoconferencing, file storage, and 
 application integration.
 
 Teams is replacing other Microsoft-operated business messaging and 
 collaboration platforms, including Skype for Business and Microsoft 
 Classroom.
