 Arcade manager provides a rom management tool, specifically designed for use with Retropie & Recalbox.
 It helps you to manage and filter your rom collection by removing unwanted, bad, and unplayable games.
 It's also useful if you feel a bit lost among the several thousand games that full MAME romsets provides, and only want the very best.
