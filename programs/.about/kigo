 Kigo is an open-source implementation of the popular Go game. 
 Go is a strategic board game for two players. It is also 
 known as igo (Japanese), weiqi or wei ch'i (Chinese) or baduk 
 (Korean). 
 Go is noted for being rich in strategic complexity despite its 
 simple rules. The game is played by two players who alternately 
 place black and white stones (playing pieces, now usually made 
 of glass or plastic) on the vacant intersections of a grid of 
 19x19 lines (9x9 or 13x13 for easier games).
