 Kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man. 
 You must go through the levels escaping ghosts in a maze. 
 You lose a life when a ghost eats you, but you can eat the
 ghosts for a few seconds when eating an energizer. 
 You win points when eating pills, energizers, and bonus, 
 and you win one life for each 10,000 points. When you have 
 eaten all the pills and energizers of a level, you go to 
 the next level, and the player and ghost speeds increase.
