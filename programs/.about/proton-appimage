 Proton is a compatibility layer for Microsoft Windows games

 by Valve in cooperation with developers from CodeWeavers 
 under contract. It is based on a fork of Wine, and includes
 several patches and libraries to improve performance and 
 compatibility with Windows games. Proton is designed for 
 integration into the Steam client as "Steam Play".
