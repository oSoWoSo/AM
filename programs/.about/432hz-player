 
 Most music is recorded in 440hz. Many people claim that 
 432hz resonates more with the heart whereas 440hz resonates 
 more with the brain, and that 432hz music feels better. Try 
 it yourself. Play a music in 440hz and in 432hz, and see 
 which one you prefer. Most people choose the 432hz version, 
 and it's hard to go back to 440hz.
