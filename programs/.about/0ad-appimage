 0 A.D. (pronounced “zero-ey-dee”) is a free, open-source, historical
 Real Time Strategy (RTS) game currently under development by Wildfire
 Games, a global group of volunteer game developers. As the leader of
 an ancient civilization, you must gather the resources you need to 
 raise a military force and dominate your enemies.
 
 This version is an AppImage compiled from the official PPA, using 
 "pkg2appimage" and "appimagetool" and takes "only" 1.7 GB after the
 creation.
 
 NOTE: the creation will take more time in compressing the AppImage,
       due to the sizes of the downloaded packages.
 
 WARNING! Each time you will launch the game, a "0 A.D. message" may
 appear with some options to choose:
 
       - by choosing "Continue" or "Suppress" you will play the game
       normally;
       - by choosing "Debugger" the game will open many istances of
       itself, and this may give problems to the stability of your
       system;
       - by choosing "Break" two times, the game will act normally;
       - by choosing "Exit" the game and the prompt will be closed.
       
 I suggest choosing "0ad-bundle" instead, because you can read the
 content of the original AppDir of this AppImage trying to fix bugs,
 customize the game using mods and spend less time in compressing the
 game and less rewritings and consuming in terms of processes and 
 resources (even if it is bigger than this AppImage version, 3.5 GB).
