 
 GNU Emacs is a free software text editor. It was created by GNU Project founder
 Richard Stallman. In common with other varieties of Emacs, GNU Emacs is
 extensible using a Turing complete programming language.
 GNU Emacs has been called "the most powerful text editor available today".

 This is the unofficial AppImage.
