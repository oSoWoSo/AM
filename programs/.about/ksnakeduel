 Snake race game. The object of the game is to avoid running 
 into walls, your own tail, and that of your opponent, while 
 at the same time you have to try to get your opponent to 
 run into them.
 
 It also includes kdesnake, a special mode of the game where 
 you can play the classical snake action game. In snake you 
 steer a snake which has to eat food. While eating, the snake 
 grows. But once a player collides with the other snake or 
 the wall, the game is lost. This becomes, of course, more 
 and more difficult the longer the snakes grow.
