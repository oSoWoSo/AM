 VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player

 DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and various streaming  protocols. 
 
 This is the unofficial AppImage of the lates version built
 from one of the best PPAs for Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver).
 
 This is the standard version without plugins, ie the one you 
 could use the most. For a more complete version, see "vlc+".
 
 NOTE, this AppImage requires the following dependences installed 
 on the host to work with the H.264 codec:
 - "ffmpeg"
 - "libqt5svg5" (on Debian and derivatives) or "qt5-svg" (on Arch 
   Linux and derivatives, Solus and Void) or "qt5-qtsvg" (on 
   Fedora, CentOS and other distributions)
