 Ice SSB is a Webapp manager from the Peppermint OS project, that convert your 
 favourite Web pages to standalone apps.
 
 This is the version optimezed for browsers installed under "AM".
 
 The difference with the original version, ie "ice", is that the /usr/bin/ice
 script into the AppImage has been patched during the creation by replacing
 the original $PATH of each browser (ie /usr/bin) with the one supported by 
 "AM" (ie /usr/local/bin), the name of the main browser supported too has 
 been changed.
 
 For more details, run "am -a ice".
     
 This AppImage will be always updated by the "am -u" command, being it weighs
 very few kilobytes. For furter updates and to join the project, visit their
 repository.
