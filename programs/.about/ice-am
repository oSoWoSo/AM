 Ice SSB is a Webapp manager from the Peppermint OS project, that convert your 
 favourite Web pages to standalone apps.
 
 This is the version optimezed for browsers installed under "AM".
 
 The difference with "AM" is that the /usr/bin/ice script into the AppImage is
 been patched during the creation by replacing the original $PATH of each 
 browser (ie /usr/bin) with the one supported by "AM" (ie /usr/local/bin).
     
 This AppImage will be always updated by the "am -u" command, being it weighs
 very few kilobytes. For furter updates and to join the project, visit their
 repository.
