 KCharSelect is a utility for finding special characters
 which are not available on the keyboard. It can search for
 characters by Unicode number, display characters in any 
 font, and copy characters to the clipboard so they can be 
 pasted into documents.

 This tool is part of the KDE Utils Suite.
