 This script is needed to quick install the main tools needed by AppMan
 and AM to create and update AppiMages:
 
 - appimageupdate, a tool needed to update an AppImage using embedded 
   information, if available (only some developers include it). 
   Source code at https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageUpdate ;
 - appimagetool, an utility needed to generate an AppImage from an 
   existing AppDir (AM/AppMan provides its version). 
   SITE and source code at https://github.com/bignaux/appimagetool ;
 - pkg2appimage, a tool needed to read and convert .yml recipes to 
   AppDirs. Source code at https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage .
   
 Note that appimagetool and pkg2appimage are required for those programs
 that require to be recompiled to be updated (see qBittorrent), while 
 appimageupdate is used by a few programs (see Celestia). 
 
 Appimageupdate, appimagetool and pkg2appimage are the only three apps 
 that AM does not authorize updates to, cause of the delicate role they
 play in the  creation and management of existing AppImage.
