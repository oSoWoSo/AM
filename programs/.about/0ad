 0 A.D. (pronounced “zero-ey-dee”) is a free, open-source, historical
 Real Time Strategy (RTS) game currently under development by Wildfire
 Games, a global group of volunteer game developers. As the leader of
 an ancient civilization, you must gather the resources you need to 
 raise a military force and dominate your enemies.
 
 This is a script that helps in choosing one of the two version
 available in "AM":
 
    - "0ad-appimage", the compressed AppImage version (only 1.7 GB); 
    - "0ad-bundle", the AppDir of the AppImage above (3.5 GB).
 
 I recommend installing the "0ad-bundle" version, because you can 
 modify and check for bugs on it easilly. I've done this choose due
 to an issue I had while testing this program, ie a "0 A.D. message"
 thet may appear with some options to choose:
 
       - by choosing "Continue" or "Suppress" you will play the game
       normally;
       - by choosing "Debugger" the game will open many istances of
       itself, and this may give problems to the stability of your
       system;
       - by choosing "Break" two times, the game will act normally;
       - by choosing "Exit" the game and the prompt will be closed.
       
 This is the only issue I've faced during my tests... apart this, the
 game is really great! Have fun!
