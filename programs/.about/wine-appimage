 WINE - Compatibility layer to run MS Windows apps and games on GNU/Linux.
 
 This is just a script that allows you to choose a version of WINE AppImage
 between:
   - A full x86_64 version for one of the three development branches (i.e. 
   "devel", "staging" and "stable") for both 32-bit and 64-bit programs;
   - A fixed 32-bit version for old programs.
