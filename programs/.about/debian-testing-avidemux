 
 Avidemux version built from https://deb-multimedia.org (Debian Testing) 
 to use the user's system theme configuration (eg Adwaita Dark or Breeze).
 The AppImage is built for Debian Testing, so it works with recent systems 
 that support GLIBC to the version used by Debian Testing when creating the 
 AppImage.
