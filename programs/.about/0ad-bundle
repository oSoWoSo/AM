 0 A.D. (pronounced “zero-ey-dee”) is a free, open-source, historical
 Real Time Strategy (RTS) game currently under development by Wildfire
 Games, a global group of volunteer game developers. As the leader of
 an ancient civilization, you must gather the resources you need to 
 raise a military force and dominate your enemies.
 
 This version is an AppDir directory not compressed downloaded and
 compiled from the official PPA. If compared to the  compressed 
 version (see "0ad-appimage") this takes much more disk space (3.5 GB
 versus the 1,7 GB of the AppImage), but being a directory it can be 
 customized and debugged the way you can use it the way you prefer.
 
 Any improvement is welcomed!
 
 WARNING! Each time you will launch the game, a "0 A.D. message" may
 appear with some options to choose:
 
       - by choosing "Continue" or "Suppress" you will play the game
       normally;
       - by choosing "Debugger" the game will open many istances of
       itself, and this may give problems to the stability of your
       system;
       - by choosing "Break" two times, the game will act normally;
       - by choosing "Exit" the game and the prompt will be closed.
       
 This is the only issue I've faced during my tests... apart this, the
 game is really great! Have fun!
