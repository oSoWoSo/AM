 appimagedl is a command line AppImage manager that integrates with 
 AppImageHub.
 If possible, 'appimageupdatetool' is used to keep AppImages up to 
 date. Otherwise, 'jq' and 'wget' are used to get the latest release 
 information using Github's API.
 
 appimagedl is not responsible for bugs within AppImages that have 
 been downloaded using appimagedl. Please report any bugs that are 
 specific to downloaded AppImages to their maintainers.
 
 This is the main script forked from the original project.
 
 NOTE, this utility can only download AppImages. It is highly 
 recommended to manage all of them with "appimagelauncher" using "AM",
 then set the path of the applications to the one managed by this fork
 of appimagedl (ie ~/.local/bin).
 See "appimagelauncher" for more information.
