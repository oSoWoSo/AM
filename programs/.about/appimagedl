 appimagedl is a command line AppImage manager that integrates 
 with AppImageHub. If possible, 'appimageupdatetool' is used to 
 keep AppImages up to date. Otherwise, 'jq' and 'wget' are used 
 to get the latest release information using Github's API.
 
 appimagedl is not responsible for bugs within AppImages that 
 have been downloaded using appimagedl. Please report any bugs 
 that are specific to downloaded AppImages to their maintainers.
 
 "AM" provides only a custom fork of the main script of this 
 project. Check the official repository for more information.
