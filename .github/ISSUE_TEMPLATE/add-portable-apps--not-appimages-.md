In order to make adding applications quicker and easier for us, try to respect the following two syntaxes.

## If available on Github.com
- name (lowercase, this will be the command to use)
- repository (URL, do not use the download link)

## If available on other sites
- name (lowercase, this will be the command to use)
- main site, repository or reference web page (URL, do not use the download link)
- download page (if different from the main page)
- description of the application

# Important!
The two syntaxes mentioned above are enough for programs that can only be used from the command line.

However, for graphical programs and programs that require integration into the menu, and therefore a launcher, also add the following two pieces of information:
- URL to the application icon
- the .desktop* file, you can choose whether...
  - add a URL to the .desktop file, if it exists
  - paste the content of the file directly
  - drag a text file into your comment
  - provide only the following desktop entries, so that we can create a minimal and unofficial launcher
    - Name=
    - Exec=
    - Categories=
